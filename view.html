                                  <p>Lets get to it</p>
                                  <em>"Lets hitchhike,"the iwisa*"</em>
                                <em>"This is why God wanted us to stay at Home"</em>
                                If you Vividly Remember this was an Early Sunday Morining and as usual it was a day to Worship,visiting three consercutive Churches.</p>
                                What who the hell goes to Three Churches a Day??
                                This was insane but well Trevors Mother was trully Determined.
                                This very day Trevor and her Mom were in riots as their Old lasting car broke down but her mother was as determined as a dear, <br>
                                    whatever the situation they must make it to Church.
                                    Here comes Trevor who is very obssed that they  have to go to Three Churches!!!.Dont get me wrong Trevor really liked going to Church but why THREE CHURCHES in a day?.
                                    Trying to convince her Mother he argued<em>This is why God wanted us to stay at home</em> when their car broke down,
                               
                                    <p>With the Apartheid system still existing which led to the division African Communities 

                               <em>People were called with their community name and race</em><em>You were either a Zulu or a Xhosa</em>
                               There were no MiniBuses at the Moment so they decided to hitch hike,
                               Later on they catch on a Minibus which endend as chaos.
                               They had to run for their lifes at the cost of being "Xhosa".
                               Trevor an her Mum were like Tom an Jerry he understood this language "Run" very wellPeople around identified him as the "Thief"
                               A thief who was always being chased.By all this happening that most of the situations Trevor was with her Mom made them become friends After appearing in the small Tom and Jerry Scene a little Boy with his Mom were happily laughing regardless of the Tragic Situation they had been in
                           I surely agree they would have just stayed at home because it was the Devil who Tricked them that Day</p>
                           <li>Shit</li>
                           <p>I actually read this and i could not believe it.One of the worlds best Comedian could do this!!</p>
                           I actually came to agreement that everyone shits even <em>Beyonce'</em>
                           Trevor was living in Soweto one of the places dominant with hustlers or Poverty .
                           The toilets there were annoying ,flies everywhere and therefore he could not have a goodtime "doing his Business"
                           Well personally i like having a quality time in the toilet just like Elon Musk Says in the toilet is where he usually takes time to reply his Messages 
                           Trevor took advantage of her Koko who was blind and decided to Shit on the floor in the Kitchen
                           He confidently performed that action regardless of the smell dominating the place and alerting her Koko Is there anyone there?
                           After hearing this it was time to get the Business done so quickly as possible</p>
                           <p>He them decided to hide his shit in the Bin,Later on her Mother found it and suspected it was witchcraft or rather a daemon.They therefore called everyone in the village for prayers.Trevor being the boy who always sealed prayers was told to seal the prayers so that God will respond quickly.Deep down Trevor knew what he had done but he hoped they could forgive him</p>
                           <li>Robbery</li>
                           <p>Trevors Mom had Taught his Son very well on how to manouver in this world to the point of learning more than one language . </p>
                           <p>This day trevor was accustomed by a group of Zulu boys who were planning to rob him off.But e was able to hear their plan and fool them that he was one of them.He was able to this since he knew all languages that communities around SouthAfrica Knew.This was very funny because they of the way Trevor was able to tick them ,regardless of him being a RedSkinned Boy</p>
