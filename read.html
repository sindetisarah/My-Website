                        <p>Coming from a Maasai Community I clearly understand the phrase below that women are only required to wait for the man to provide.As woman you are only supposed to Engage in House Chores and perform Domestic Engineering.In our Community the man has say in everything and women's opinion or input is disregarded.So if there is anyone that understands this well is me,because i have been exposed to it.I clearly appreciate Trevor Noah for bringing this out loud and let it seize and diminish for good.Women should be respected! and submission does not mean oppression.They are clearly important,and the World need them for sure.Lets take a quick review</p>
                       <em>"...The traditional man wants a woman to be 
    subservient, but he never falls in love with subservient women. He’s attracted to independent women. 
    “He’s like an exotic bird collector,” she said. “He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage..."</em>

                       <h5>Abel's View</h5>
                       <p>Abel is clearly a Male Chauvinist,by the way he treats Patricia.He beats her to the point of pooling a trigger on her,not afraid to kill Patricia.When they go to thje Police station Abel puts blame on Patricia and he his set free.He is only there to take alcohol and drugs.What kind of a world is this.This clearly shows that this community is male dominated and females opinion are disregarded when they actually speak the Truth.This is nothing like Submission but claerly a cage that every woman tied in it needs to be saved </p>
                    <h5>Abel's Home</h5>
                    <p>Going to Abels Home still we see the same thing.The women are the ones doing everything.Working in the Kitchen ad serving the men .But they still afford to beat up a woman?.Nope this claerly need to CHANGE COME RAIN,COME SUN SHINE.Even with the list they cant chip in.Patricia is forced to bow to them .Regardless she does it sarcastically until they are obsessed with her</p>
                    <h5>Dinky</h5>
                    <p>Dinky says out and loud how he usually beats his wife and enjoys it.Women have know become a property to be bought and played with.This is very unfair and should be discouraged and erased totally in our communities</p>
                    <h5>Women are still powerfull</h5>
                    <p>Patricia shows how women have the power to go out there and make a living.She potrays how women are Great all they need is to be given a chance.She works really hard to provide for his family.She is aware of herself.Ithink Abel was  like a burden to her pulling her down.I also feel sorry for her cause she felt obligated to Abel after Trevor the burning house making Abel to lose his job</p>
                  <h5>Men should kill the Hypocrisy</h5>
                  <p>Its not hard to appreciate women who work hard.Men should allow that competition in a good way.It does not mean women are disrespectful otherwise they would not be attracted to them.For everyone is attracted to a mango ehich is ripe that which can give a fulfillment</p>
